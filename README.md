# reviewer


Prompt for creating PDF
When creating your future reviewer PDF, format each item as plain text (single column, no tables) so the site can parse it. Start every question on a new line using a number followed by a period (e.g., 1.), then write the full question text on the same line or the next line. Put each answer choice on its own line using only A–D and a consistent marker like A), B), C), D). After all questions, add a section header exactly written as Answer Explanations, and under it list the answers in this exact pattern: 1. Correct answer: D, followed by 1–4 short lines explaining why that option is correct, then continue to the next number. Keep answer letters uppercase (A, B, C, D), avoid extra numbering inside the question text, and don’t place the answer key in tables or columns to prevent PDF extraction issues.
